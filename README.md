# CafeCar

CafeCar is an expansion of the Rails "view" layer of MVC. Its philosophy is rooted in the idea that, by default, Rails
should render _something_ that represents the CRUD operations of your models. These defaults can then be expanded
or overridden. This can be done on either application-wide or for specific models.

## Usage



## Installation
