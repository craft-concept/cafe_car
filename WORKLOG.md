# CafeCar Worklog

Running narrative of each operating pass, newest first. Each entry: what shipped
(commit SHAs), what's in flight, decisions/assumptions, what's next.

## 2026-06-27 — Pass 13 (self-paced loop): CrayonBloom dogfooding wired via the board

**Cross-venture mechanism discovered.** Polling the holdco board surfaced a new task
(`dogfood-milestone-build-cafecar-to-meet-the-crayonbloom-back`, filed 01:08): the **CrayonBloom
operator is the spec author** and files individual requirement tasks to my board
(`venture=cafe_car`); **CafeCar is the builder** and picks them up in priority order. This is how
[[dogfood-crayonbloom]]'s "needs requirements" stall gets answered — via the board, not the owner
in QUESTIONS.md. **No concrete requirement tasks have landed yet** — only the milestone.

**Actions this pass:**
- Re-pointed [[dogfood-crayonbloom]] (`blocked_on: crayonbloom-operator`) and the QUESTIONS.md
  dogfood section to the board mechanism; the generic readiness map stays as my baseline.
- **Synced 3 stale board tasks to done** (`bin/holdco api:done`): docs-site-live-demo,
  generator-polish, nested-attributes-forms were done locally but still showed open on the board.
  Board now accurately shows only discoverability-launch (owner-blocked publish), dogfood-crayonbloom
  (awaiting reqs), and the milestone open for cafe_car.
- Otherwise unchanged: no owner response, 0 open issues/PRs, CI green, demo healthy.

**Loop change:** the new primary signal is "a CrayonBloom requirement task appears on the board" —
external API state the harness can't push to me, so the loop now **polls the board each cycle** at a
~20-min cadence and builds whatever requirement tasks have landed.

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 12 (self-paced loop): README hero screenshot shipped; V1 must-fix list verified closed

**Re-assessed:** no owner response yet to the QUESTIONS.md asks, 0 open issues / 0 open PRs, CI
green, live demo healthy (root + `/admin/clients` 200). Owner-blocked items still blocked.

**Record correction:** verified the V1_SCOPE "must-fix" list is now **fully closed** — item 5
(coverage for advertised paths) was done but [[fix-halfbaked-features]]'s note still said
"REMAINING". Confirmed `test/controllers/{json_responses,turbo_stream,sort_and_paginate}_test.rb`
+ `test/presenters/cafe_car/record_presenter_test.rb` all exist, are active, and pass (within the
102). README doc-drift (`normalized_sort_key`, `.errors`) also already gone. Corrected the note
(`<commit below>`). The gem is in honest 1.0-candidate shape.

**README hero screenshot** ([[readme-hero-screenshot]], filed + delegated this pass; builder
commit "Add live-demo hero screenshot…", CI + Pages green): the README and Pages landing page
were text-only — now they lead with a real screenshot of the live auto-generated admin.
- **Hero:** `/admin/invoices` index — dense 8-column auto-generated table (sortable headers,
  currency formatting, association links, sender avatars, relative timestamps) + "Displaying
  1-25 of 200" pagination. I viewed it — clean, compelling, no errors. `docs/images/admin-invoices-index.png`.
- **Secondary:** `/admin/invoices/new` nested-attributes form, in the README "Forms" section.
- Captured via puppeteer-provisioned headless Chrome (no system Chrome) at 1800px/2x, palette-
  quantized (326 KB / 58 KB). Embedded with absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs (render on
  github.com + rubygems.org) in README, site-relative path in `docs/index.md`.
- **Gem exclusion verified myself:** `gem build` → **0** `.png`/`docs/` entries. `rake` green.

**Why proactive:** the prepared launch kit ([[discoverability-launch]]) points every channel at
the README — a visual hero materially lifts conversion. Squarely in the "visibility + trust"
mission; reversible PR to main.

**Board state:** unchanged otherwise — only [[discoverability-launch]] (publish) and
[[dogfood-crayonbloom]] (CrayonBloom reqs) remain, both owner-blocked. Loop returns to monitoring.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 11 (self-paced loop): closed issue #10 + advanced dogfood P1; backlog drained of unblocked work

**Community:** closed the repo's only open issue, **#10 "Nested fields_for has_many models"** —
it asked for exactly what pass 8 shipped (`7896820`). Verified the feature works end-to-end
(the live demo's `/admin/invoices/new` renders nested line-item fields: 22 `line_items_attributes`,
a `<template>`, the `+ Line item` button; Invoice `has_many :line_items` +
`accepts_nested_attributes_for ..., allow_destroy: true`) and that the override path the issue
requested is implemented (`app/views/<plural>/_fields.html.haml` overrides the default — see
`_nested_field.html.haml`). Closed with a usage writeup citing the live demo. **Repo now has 0
open issues / 0 open PRs.**

**Generator polish verified** (`df1543a`, delegated earlier this session): all three footguns
fixed at the root, each with a test; suite **99 → 102 runs / 316 assertions / 0 failures**, CI
green. (Builder report accurate this time — re-ran the suite myself to confirm.)

**Dogfood P1 advanced** ([[dogfood-crayonbloom]]): did the unblocked half — a back-office
readiness map (CafeCar capabilities vs. generic back-office needs) on the task file. The ✅ rows
(CRUD, Pundit auth+roles, opt-in sessions, filtering, sort/paginate, nested assoc forms, Active
Storage, Action Text, PaperTrail) already cover a clients/invoices-style admin — proven on the
demo. Deltas (CSV export, bulk actions, keyword search, dashboards) are flagged as candidate Eng
tasks *only if CrayonBloom needs them*. Filed 5 concrete requirement questions to QUESTIONS.md →
task `blocked_on: user`.

**Board state:** every unblocked task is now done. The only two open tasks are owner-blocked —
[[discoverability-launch]] (publish go-ahead + blog host) and [[dogfood-crayonbloom]]
(CrayonBloom requirements). Both have clear owner asks in QUESTIONS.md.

**What's next:** nothing actionable until the owner responds. The loop stays alive on a longer
monitoring cadence to catch owner answers, new issues/PRs, CI breakage, and cross-venture tasks
on the holdco board.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Generator polish (destination/namespace/delegation consistency)

Fixed the three non-blocking generator footguns in [[generator-polish]] at the root (none was
an adopter-facing bug; all confirmed working in a host app). Suite grew 99 → **102 runs / 316
assertions / 0 failures**; full `rake` green (rubocop 200 files / 0 offenses, brakeman 0 warnings).

- **Destination leak:** added a shared inline `generate` helper to `CafeCar::Generators` that
  delegates via `Rails::Generators.invoke(..., destination_root:)` instead of Rails' built-in
  `generate`, which recomputes the destination from `Rails::Command.root` and leaks writes into
  the engine repo / escapes the test destination. `ResourceGenerator` now includes the concern and
  drops the redundant `inline: true`.
- **`notes` subprocess shell-out:** now flows through the same inline helper — consistent with
  `resource` and runnable in the harness.
- **Policy double-namespace:** `PolicyGenerator` overrides `class_name = file_name.camelize`
  (mirrors the controller generator) so `module_namespacing` supplies the single `module Admin`;
  `model_class` now looks up by `file_path` to keep namespaced lookups intact.

Tests for each fix; the resource/notes capture stubs moved onto subclasses so they no longer leak
into the new real-inline tests.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 10 (self-paced loop): discoverability/launch kit PREPARED (roadmap #6)

With the live demo up (pass 9), [[discoverability-launch]]'s prerequisites (CI green, hygiene
docs, audited v1, live demo) are all met — so I had a builder draft the full launch kit.
**Prepared only, nothing published** — the publish step is owner-blocked.

**Shipped** (`c69d697`, delegated; CI green): a new top-level `marketing/` dir (excluded from
the built gem — gemspec globs `{app,config,db,lib}`):
- `launch-post.md` — ~850-word post, thesis **"Rails should render something by default"**:
  your models already describe a resource, so Rails should render a real, overridable CRUD
  admin from them — not throwaway scaffolds, not a heavyweight second framework. Honest about
  pre-1.0, leads with the demo, accurate `cafe_car` + generator snippets. (Reviewed it myself —
  genuinely good, no overselling.)
- `awesome-list-entries.md`, `rubyflow-and-toolbox.md`, `SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` — paste-ready
  entries + an ordered owner-action list (Ruby Toolbox, Awesome Rails/Ruby PRs, RubyFlow,
  Show HN, Reddit, Discord/Slack, X/Mastodon), each with URL + what to paste.

**Owner decisions filed** (QUESTIONS.md "🚀 Launch go/no-go"): (a) go-ahead to submit, (b) where
to host the blog post (canonical URL everything links to), (c) which channels, (d) confirm the
demo can take an HN/Reddit spike. Task → `blocked_on: user` (stays `open`).

**Flagged risk:** Awesome Ruby enforces a ~30k-download minimum — CafeCar is below it today, so
that one PR is recommended to wait until downloads clear the bar; the other venues have no gate.

**Verify note:** the builder misreported "51 tests" — actual suite is **99 runs / 299 assertions
/ 0 failures** (ran it myself), CI green, tree clean. Deliverable sound; just a sloppy number.

**What's next:** [[generator-polish]] (P2, the only remaining unblocked code task — contributor
dev-safety footguns: destination/namespace/delegation consistency). Then the long tail is
owner-blocked: [[discoverability-launch]] (publish), [[dogfood-crayonbloom]] (CrayonBloom reqs).

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 9 (self-paced loop): LIVE DEMO shipped — roadmap item #5

**The CafeCar live clickable demo is public and verified.** Roadmap item #5 — "the single
highest-converting trust artifact" — is done: skeptics can now evaluate the gem without
installing it.

**Live demo:** https://cafe-car-demo-production.up.railway.app — one click ("Enter the
demo →") into the auto-generated `/admin` CRUD for clients, invoices, articles, users, notes,
all seeded with FactoryBot data. Independently verified: root + `/admin/{clients,invoices}`
all 200, 10 seeded client rows render (no login wall), assets load, `http→https` 301.

**What shipped** (delegated to a `general-purpose` builder; commits on main):
- `035d558` — root `Dockerfile` (builds the whole repo since the dummy loads the gem via
  `gemspec`; precompiles assets), `.dockerignore`, `bin/railway-demo` (reseeds ephemeral
  SQLite on every boot → visitor edits self-clean on restart), `test/dummy` `production.rb`
  (`assume_ssl`, static-file serving, Railway host-authorization), home-page one-click CTA +
  "data resets periodically" banner.
- `d02dd38` — "🚀 Live demo" callout near the top of README + `docs/index.md`; task → done.
- **No gem auth changes** — the dummy's Pundit `ApplicationPolicy#admin? => true` already
  grants access. `lib/`/`app/`/gemspec untouched, as required. `rake` green (rubocop 0,
  99 tests, brakeman 0); CI green on both commits.

**Railway:** project "CafeCar Demo" (`73ddf2a2…`), service `cafe-car-demo` (`aef404ac…`),
small single web service, no Postgres. `SECRET_KEY_BASE` stored as a Railway service var.

**Decisions/assumptions:** SQLite + boot-time reseed (no volume) — vandalism self-cleans on
each restart; no timer-based reset (add a scheduled redeploy if a guaranteed cadence is
wanted). Verified the builder's stale follow-up: **GitHub Pages is already live** (`status:
built`, serving `main` `/docs`) — corrected the task note; no action needed.

**What's next:** [[discoverability-launch]] (roadmap #6) is now **unblocked** — the demo link
exists to point launch posts at. Its outward actions (Awesome Rails/Ruby PRs, RubyFlow post,
launch blog post) are publish-to-external and need the owner's accounts/go-ahead, so next pass
I'll *prepare* the artifacts (draft post + Awesome-list entry) without publishing, and file an
owner question for where to host/announce. Long-tail open: [[generator-polish]] (P2, dev-safety
cleanups), [[dogfood-crayonbloom]] (P1, owner/CrayonBloom-blocked).

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 8 (self-paced loop): v0.1.2 SHIPPED — release reconciliation + nested-attributes

**Owner published v0.1.2 to RubyGems** (uploaded 2026-06-27T01:00Z, built from `6b4f269`).
Roadmap milestones #1 (CHANGELOG) and #2 (publish v0.1.2) are **done**. The loop did not
freeze (per `6b4f269`); it reconciled the release and shipped the next feature.

**Release reconciliation** (the published 0.1.2 = current main, but the tag/CHANGELOG were
71 commits behind reality):
- Owner decisions: next dev version **0.2.0** (minor); **move the stale `v0.1.2` tag** to the
  shipped commit + cut GitHub releases.
- CHANGELOG honest 0.1.2 entry mined from the 71 shipped commits; `version.rb` → `0.2.0`;
  fresh empty `[Unreleased]` (`d583882`, `af1c1cb` lockfile sync; delegated). `rake` green.
- Moved `v0.1.2` tag → `6b4f269` (force, pushed). Cut GitHub releases for **v0.1.2** (Latest)
  and **v0.1.1** for a complete page.
- Housekeeping: `*.gem` build artifacts now gitignored, removed the stray `cafe_car-0.1.2.gem`
  (`b9f1ff5`).

**Nested-attributes form rendering** (`7896820`, delegated) — first-class `has_many` +
`accepts_nested_attributes_for` forms: `_nested_field.html.haml` (`fields_for` + `<template>`
for new rows), vanilla-JS add/remove with `_destroy` handling, `nested_attributes_type`
moved to front of `FieldInfo#type`. Tests **90 → 99**, `rake` + CI green. Regression guard
verified: `nested_attributes_type` returns `nil` unless `accepts_nested_attributes_for` is
configured, so belongs_to/plain-has_many rendering is unaffected. Closes
[[nested-attributes-forms]] (the reimplementation of closed PR #11, done right with tests).

**Filed:** [[bump-ci-actions-checkout-to-v5-node-20-deprecation]] (P2) — CI logs a Node 20
deprecation warning on `actions/checkout@v4` (not failing yet).

**Decisions/assumptions:** Builder subagent types `coder`/`designer` aren't registered in this
environment → used `general-purpose` for builds (same full abilities, scoped prompt). The
published 0.1.2 commit was identified as `6b4f269` (session-start HEAD with the owner's built
`.gem` sitting untracked).

**Next:** backlog is now P2 long-tail (generator-polish, docs-site/demo deploy — gate is
owner go-ahead + Railway cost, discoverability — sequence after demo). Loop continues.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 7+ (self-paced loop): PR triage + generator tests

Running as a self-paced operating loop. Progress:
- **Closed stale draft PR #11** (nested has_many fields) with a courteous, specific
  explanation; filed [[nested-attributes-forms]] to reimplement it properly with tests
  (PR was untested + stale against a diverged main). Responsive-maintainer signal.
- **Generator test coverage** (`f6ae7ed`, delegated) — generator tests **3 → 21**, full
  suite **60 → 78**, `rake` + CI green. Covered install (Gemfile/routes/AppController
  injections), resource, controller, policy, notes.
- Surfaced 3 non-blocking generator issues → filed [[generator-polish]]: `resource`
  pollutes the engine repo when run from root; `notes` shells out instead of `inline: true`;
  `policy` double-namespaces. None are adopter-facing bugs.
- `fix-halfbaked-features` items 1–4 now done; only item 5 (tests for advertised
  turbo_stream/json/presenter/sort-paginate paths) remains — claimed next.

**Advertised-path tests** (`3c673a2`, delegated) — turbo_stream, json (confirms
non-displayable attrs don't leak), presenter render, sort/paginate. Suite **78 → 90**, no
broken paths found. `fix-halfbaked-features` done.

### Loop paused — gem is publish-ready

Autonomous, clearly-safe quality work is exhausted. State: CI green, 0 vulns, full OSS
hygiene + live Pages, honest v1 scope, cnc cut, rubocop-omakase, sessions optional+finished,
**90 tests** (generators + every advertised path). ~17 tasks done this session.

Remaining backlog is **owner-gated or low-value**, so the loop is paused (no point
idle-ticking on decisions only the owner can make):
- **Owner-gated:** `gem push` v0.1.x (RubyGems key); `docs-site-live-demo` (Railway deploy —
  cost/account + go-ahead); `dogfood-crayonbloom` (needs requirements); `potter`→cnc
  transitive; sessions homepage already resolved.
- **Owner-visible / discretionary:** `nested-attributes-forms` (a new feature — don't ship
  unprompted); `discoverability-launch` (sequence after publish + demo); `generator-polish`
  (P2 cosmetic; changing generator delegation isn't worth the regression risk unprompted).

Resumes on the owner's next message (answering a gate re-engages the highest-value work).

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 6: owner decisions — cut cnc, omakase, Pages

Owner ratified the pending decisions (cut cnc wholesale; rubocop→rails-omakase; sessions
optional AND finished; homepage→GitHub Pages). Reshaped the backlog accordingly.

**Shipped (on `main`, `rake` green):**
- **Cut cnc wholesale + rubocop→omakase** (`4387c07`, delegated) — inlined the two methods
  CafeCar used (`Hash#extract_if!`, `Module#define_class`) into `core_ext/`, removed the
  dep from gemspec + Gemfile + install generator, switched `.rubocop.yml` to inherit
  `rubocop-rails-omakase` (autocorrected 278 offenses across ~73 files, zero hand-fixes),
  and repointed `homepage` to GitHub Pages. cnc grep-clean; tests 51/0.
- **GitHub Pages landing page** (this commit) — `docs/` landing page + enabling Pages so
  the new homepage URL resolves (partial progress on [[docs-site-live-demo]]; the live
  clickable demo remains).

**Flag for owner:** cnc still resolves **transitively via `potter`** (potter → cnc) in
`Gemfile.lock` — out of CafeCar's own deps, but if you want cnc gone from the install tree
entirely, `potter` would need the same treatment.

**Sessions — optional AND finished** (`f4b1fda` Part A, `d91d2a1` Part B, delegated):
- **Optional / 500 fix:** `render_unauthorized` now `head :forbidden` when sessions aren't
  available (`CafeCar.sessions_available?` = login route exists AND sessions table exists,
  **fails closed** via rescue). CRUD-only hosts get a clean 403, not a 500. Reviewed the
  auth path directly — it fails closed, no access leak. Also fixed a latent i18n 500 in the
  login redirect.
- **Finished:** engine `resource :session` routes; configurable host user via
  `CafeCar.user_class_name` (default `"User"`); logout action; honest generator + USAGE;
  README "Sessions & Authentication" section. 9 new tests (51 → 60). `rake` + CI green.
- Conductor fixed a one-line stale code comment (`user_class` → `user_class_name`) and
  noted the supersession in `V1_SCOPE.md`.

**All four owner decisions are now shipped.** Homepage verified live (HTTP 200 at
craft-concept.github.io/cafe_car).

**Next:** remaining backlog — `triage-pr-11`, `docs-site-live-demo` (live demo beyond the
landing page), `discoverability-launch`, `dogfood-crayonbloom` (needs owner requirements).
Owner-gated: the `gem push` itself, and whether to chase cnc out of the `potter` transitive.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 5: GitHub templates

**Shipped (on `main`, CI green):** issue forms (`bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`),
issue-template `config.yml` (routes security reports to SECURITY.md, questions to the
README), and a `pull_request_template.md` with the `rake`-green / tests / CHANGELOG
checklist. Completes OSS-hygiene roadmap item #4. **10 tasks done.**

Remaining unblocked: auth graceful-403 fix, `triage-pr-11`. Owner-gated: cnc inline/demote,
sessions direction, homepage 404, the publish, CrayonBloom dogfood requirements.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 4: release-prep polish

**Shipped (on `main`, CI green):**
- **Retroactive release tags** `v0.1.1` (`d73eb6f`) / `v0.1.2` (`256f822`) so the CHANGELOG
  compare/release links resolve. Tags only — not a publish.
- **gemspec release-polish** (`333754b`, delegated) — replaced the placeholder
  summary/description with a real value-prop pitch, added `required_ruby_version >= 3.3`,
  conservative `>=` floors on the direct deps (matching the lockfile), and
  `rubygems_mfa_required` + `bug_tracker_uri` metadata. `cnc`/`potter` left bare (pre-1.0).
  Completes roadmap item #2 **prep** — everything short of the owner-gated `gem push`.

**Flagged for the owner (QUESTIONS.md):** the gem `homepage` (`concept.love/cafe_car`)
404s — stand up the page or repoint to GitHub (left as-is, didn't guess at branding).

**State:** 9 tasks done. Remaining unblocked: auth graceful-403 fix, `github-templates`,
`triage-pr-11`. Owner-gated: cnc inline/demote, sessions direction, homepage, the actual
publish, CrayonBloom dogfood requirements.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 3: README honesty + CI gate cleanup

**Shipped (all on `main`, CI green):**
- **README accuracy + badges** (`7ab7903`, delegated) — fixed the false-advertising
  (`f.field(...).errors`→`.error`, `normalized_sort_key`→`normalize_sort_key`), corrected
  the install gem-list and Prerequisites to honest tested versions (Ruby 3.3+/Rails 8.0+),
  added CI/gem-version/license badges. Auth stack correctly left undocumented (experimental).
- **CI rubocop gate cleanup** (conductor, this commit) — the job ran `rubocop -Af github`
  and opened a "Rubocop Autocorrections on main" PR on every push (amateur-looking on a
  public repo, and it masked real lint failures). Switched to a check-only gate
  (`rubocop -f github`), removed the create-pull-request step, and deleted the stale
  `rubocop/main` branch.

**Sharpened diagnosis (for the auth fix):** the latent 500 is more entangled than "remove
the include" — `render_unauthorized` itself calls the Authentication concern and redirects
to `new_session_path`, a route the engine never defines. The direction-independent fix is
graceful 403 degradation when sessions aren't configured. Recorded in
`fix-halfbaked-features`.

**Next pass:** the auth graceful-403 fix (owner-independent bug fix, but I'll likely wait
for the sessions product direction before deciding how far to wire login); `retro-tag-releases`;
then `gemspec-release-polish` toward a credible (owner-gated) v0.1.x publish. Owner-gated:
cnc inline/demote, sessions direction.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 2: security cleanup + honest v1 scope

**Shipped (all on `main`, CI green):**
- **Cleared every Dependabot alert** (`f02c924`, delegated) — 56 → **0** open, including
  the 1 critical (`rack-session`) and all 14 high (rack, puma, rails 8.1.2→8.1.3, nokogiri,
  etc.). Surgical `Gemfile.lock`-only bumps; `rake` stayed green; no gemspec changes.
- **Feature audit → `V1_SCOPE.md`** (`43b4aa7`, delegated) — every advertised feature
  classified **8 IN / 7 NEEDS-WORK / 2 OUT** with file-level evidence.

**Key findings / decisions:**
- **Auth/sessions is half-baked and carries a latent 500**: `Authentication` is
  force-included into every CRUD `Controller`, so a CRUD-only host with no sessions table
  can 500. The decouple is an unambiguous bug fix (queued in `fix-halfbaked-features`); the
  *product* call — ship experimental vs. finish vs. cut — is raised to the owner in
  QUESTIONS.md.
- **README false advertising** found (trust killers): `f.field(...).errors` → `.error`;
  `normalized_sort_key()` → `normalize_sort_key`; the `sessions` generator USAGE lies; the
  auth stack is undocumented; install gem-list is incomplete. Folded into the fix tasks.
- Builder hygiene held: both builders kept to disjoint files, cleaned generator artifacts,
  and left the committed tree green.

**Flagged for the owner (QUESTIONS.md):** sessions experimental-vs-finish-vs-cut decision
(new); cnc inline/demote (still pending).

**Next pass:** ship the README accuracy fixes (pure trust wins, in flight); then the
auth-decoupling bug fix; then `ci-rubocop-check-gate` + retro tags. The auth *product*
direction and cnc are the two owner-gated items.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Pass 1: CI rescue, backlog genesis, first hygiene wave

**Shipped (all on `main`, CI green):**
- **Fixed red CI** (`8970798`). Root cause was three-fold: `bin/brakeman` forced
  `--ensure-latest`, tying build pass/fail to brakeman's release cadence (8.0.5 shipped
  vs. locked 8.0.4 → exit 5); a stale `brakeman.ignore` fingerprint (generated under
  8.0.2) resurfaced the auto_resolver eval warning (exit 3); and the holdco onboarding
  commit left 65 rubocop offenses. Decoupled the gate, refreshed the fingerprint,
  autocorrected. `rake` fully green (0 offenses, 51 runs/0 failures, 0 warnings).
- **Built the backlog from zero** (`4f9c639`) — 12 triaged tasks translating the owner's
  directive into stability / OSS-hygiene / cnc / GTM / dogfood workstreams.
- **OSS community files** (`d05b2a2`, delegated to a builder) — CHANGELOG.md (Keep-a-
  Changelog), CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, and gemspec
  `changelog_uri`. Expanded the README Contributing section to link them.
- **cnc investigation** (`78d902c`, delegated) — recommendation written to QUESTIONS.md.

**Decisions / assumptions:**
- `cnc` is **public**, not private (the AGENTS.md premise is stale) — it's the owner's own
  gem (4.5k downloads, MIT). So it is *not* an adoption blocker; the real issue is that
  it's a runtime dep dragging rubocop/thor/listen into production for two ~10-line
  monkeypatches. **Recommendation: inline those two methods + demote cnc to a dev
  dependency.** Surfaced to the owner in QUESTIONS.md; execution task
  (`cnc-inline-and-demote`) is **blocked on owner ratification**.
- Kept the CI brakeman gate decoupled from gem currency rather than chasing each release;
  dependency freshness belongs to bundle update / Dependabot, not the build gate.

**Flagged for the owner (QUESTIONS.md / blockers):**
- cnc dependency-strategy decision (see above).
- RubyGems publish key + version bump still owner-gated — no publish attempted.

**New follow-ups filed:** `deps-vulnerability-audit` (Dependabot: 56 vulns, 1 critical /
14 high — **P1**), `cnc-inline-and-demote` (P1, owner-blocked), `retro-tag-releases`
(no git tags exist; CHANGELOG links won't resolve until tagged), `triage-pr-11` (stale
Copilot draft PR from March).

**Next pass:** highest-leverage open item is `deps-vulnerability-audit` (security/trust)
or `feature-audit-v1-scope` (the owner's stability #1, gates the demo and dogfood). Also
quick wins: `ci-rubocop-check-gate` (drop the autocorrect-and-PR job; delete the stale
`rubocop/main` branch) and `readme-badges-accuracy`.
